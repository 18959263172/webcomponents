Web Components
===============

Web Components are a new browser feature that provides a standard component model for the Web, consisting of several pieces:

- [Shadow DOM](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/).
    - The current issue tracker: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues)
    - The old [issue tracker](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/showdependencytree.cgi?id=14978), which was not used any longer.
    - It has been a long team goal to upstream the Shadow DOM spec into the [DOM spec](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/).
- [HTML Imports](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/).
- [Custom Elements](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/).
- HTML Templates. HTML Templates was upstreamed into the [HTML spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-template-element).
