Web Components
===============

Web Components are a new browser feature that provides a unified component model for the Web, consisting of several pieces:

- [Shadow DOM](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/).
    - Issue Tracker: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues)
    - You might want to see the closed issues before filing a new issue: [Closed issues on W3C Bugzilla](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/showdependencytree.cgi?id=14978)
- [HTML Imports](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/).
- [Custom Elements](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/).
